# Undergrad_AI_Projects
Here are some of the projects I have done for my AI course in the undergraduate level.

I have implemented birectional search, ids, and A* algorithms on 8-puzzle problem.

These algorithms will solve the problem in the case that the problem is solvable itself.

Also, I've implemented hill climbing on 8-queen!
